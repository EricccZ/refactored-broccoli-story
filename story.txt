Eric is a student of UW-Madios who majors in mathematics and computer science.
He would like to get into a consulting firm after he graduates.

Eric knows that his road will be challenging. Mathematics and computer science
are both very difficult and competitive majors. He will have to endure long
nights of studying for tests and completing projects all while maintaining a
healthy college lifestyle. He plans to overcome these challenges in a few
different ways. 

Eric plans on making the most of his day by using a calendar and productivity apps to make sure he is making good use of his time. He also makes sure to go to all of his lectures and take notes. He also plans on being able to go out atleast twice a month to go and have a great time with his friends. This all was going fine until one day.

It is all over Eric is graduating. He made the most of his time while in 
college. Eric is sad to be leaving it all behind as college is a special time that never happens again in ones life. On the bright side all the hardwork
that Eric put in paid off as he landed a prestigous job at boston consulting
group.

After Eric graduate from UW-Madison, he becomes an employee of boston consulting group, as he wished. As long as people try to work hard, and try his/her best to chase the dream, life will pay you back one day.
